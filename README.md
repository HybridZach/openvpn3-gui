# openvpn3-gui
# A python QT5 GUI for openvpn3 backend.

This application seeks to provide a basic/minimalistic GUI for openvpn3 CLI using Python & QT5.

Eventually it will be cross-platform but for now its Linux only.<br />
Plans to upload the initial stable(ish) version, then go from there.<br />
Going to implement openvpn3 python API and DBUS functionality eventually also (For now it uses system CLI calls)
